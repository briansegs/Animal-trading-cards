# Animal-trading-cards

[Animal Trading Cards](https://briansegs.github.io/Animal-trading-cards/) Webpage

This was a project i completed for Udacity's Introduction to programming. I submitted one HTML file with 5 cards in it. Repeating the code in the HTML file and then adding just one line of code in the CSS file made it easy to make multiple cards. It was almost like a template so now I can make all the animal trading cards I want. I even made one for Sam, the dog I watch every now and then.

After I submitted and passed this project I decided to fix all of my mistakes and make another set of cards for fun. Now there are 10 in all! Im really happy with the way they turned out and I learned so much from this project.
