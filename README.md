# Animal-trading-cards

This is the "Animal trading card" project I completed for Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree. The goal of this project was to only use HTML and CSS coding languages to make trading cards with an animal theme.

I submitted one HTML and CSS file with 5 cards coded into them. I repeated the code in the HTML file and then added just one line of code per card to the CSS file making it easy to produce multiple cards. I wanted to make a template so that it would be easy to make all the animal trading cards I want. I even made one for Sam, the dog I watch every now and then.

After I submitted and passed the project I decided to fix all of my mistakes and make another set of cards for fun. Now there are 10 in all! I'm thrilled with the way they turned out and I learned a lot along the way.

Check out all 10 here: [Animal Trading Cards](https://briansegs.github.io/Animal-trading-cards/)
